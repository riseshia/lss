Linear System Simulation

## Introduction
This Site is built for simulating Linear system simulation.
For easy understanding, I limit to use only one Sinusoid.

And It don't provide IIR filter, but only FIR filter.

you can apply filter as b_k, e.g. '1', '1,2,1', '0.5,0.5', '0,0,1'.
please note that you should use filter which seems symmetric.
